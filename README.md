- Click the extension icon.
- Select the region of the code or click the extension icon again to cancel selection.
- Wait for the processing to take place.
- Once processed, the code will be copied to your clipboard. You can also compare the code and the image side by side to identify any potential errors.



## Important
- The technology used to extract code from videos is called Tesseract, which may not always produce 100% accurate results.
- The accuracy will depend on the type of image captured. For better results, ensure that the video is played at the highest quality before selecting the region.
- All processing is performed locally, ensuring the privacy of your data.
